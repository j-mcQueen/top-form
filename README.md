# sign-up form

An in-browser dummy sign-up form built as part of The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript course. Check out the [finished version](https://j-mcQueen.github.io/top-form/). Rather than create a fully functional sign-up form, the main learning outcome of this project was to practice form accessibility and styling methods.

## new things I've learned

- How a screen reader interprets sign-up forms
- Writing accessible HTML that ensures a positive user-experience of a form for users who use assistive technologies
- Using pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes to generate content which acts as a visual indicator for required form elements
- The efficiency of using advanced CSS selectors (like combinators or attribute selectors)
- The various advantages of using CSS variables (such as only editing values in one place rather than several)
- Manipulating SVG size and colour

## biggest challenges

- Positioning generated content
- Ensuring the majority of the relevant form element attributes necessary for accessibility purposes are implemented

## technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- [Softr's SVG Shape Generator](https://www.softr.io/tools/svg-shape-generator)

## known bugs/ areas of improvement

- For this project, emphasis was placed on building an accessible sign-up form and applying form styling techniques, so while the form exhibits a basic sense of responsiveness, the page is not robust in that regard.
