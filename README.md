# sign-up form

A dummy sign-up form built as part of The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript course. Check out the [finished version](). Rather than create a fully functional sign-up form, the main learning outcome of this project was to practice form accessibility and styling methods.

## new things I've learned

- how a screen reader interprets sign-up forms
- writing accessible HTML that ensures a positive user-experience of a form for users who use assistive technologies
- using pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes to generate content which acts as a visual indicator for required form elements
- the efficiency of using advanced CSS selectors (like combinators or attribute selectors)
- the various advantages of using CSS variables (such as only editing values in one place rather than several)
- manipulating SVG size and colour

## biggest challenges

- positioning generated content
- ensuring the majority of the relevant form element attributes necessary for accessibility purposes are implemented
